### ScalEngine

Game engine I plan on writing in C++20 to improve. I plan on trying to make most of it from scratch.

You can use premake5.exe or build.bat to generate your project.
I mostly build with vs2022 and clang.

- build.bat also includes a clang script, It should work but I do not use it that often
- Not sure how the cross platform support will be.
